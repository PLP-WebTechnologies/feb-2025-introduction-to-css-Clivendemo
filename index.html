        <h1 id="maintitle">History Of Freretown </h1>
        <p class="text">Frere town Secondary School is based in Frere Town area within Nyali Constituency off the Mombasa Malindi highway at Kisimani Stage. (approximately 1Km).
         The inspiration for Frere Town Secondary School came in 2016 when a small group of members of the FRERE Community, Parents and local leaders envisioned a 
         local school based within the Frere Town Primary School owing to the increasing demand for secondary school education.
         By July 2016, the school was registered with less than 50 students, though it did not have classrooms. 
         <p class="text">It started as mixed day school. The primary school allowed the school to use two of its classrooms for form one and form 2 students. 
          The school got a boost when the constituency development fund through the then area MP put up 8 classrooms. One of the classrooms was
         converted to an administration office to house the main administrative offices. The school continued to expand and a lab was also put 
         up by the Constituency Development Fund under patronage of the area member of national assembly. (MP) in 2019.
         </p><p class="text">As confidence quickly grew in  School and its strong team of teachers. There began to be a steady flow of students from the local community 
         and currently the school population stands at 500 students.</p>
